        <h1>Origin Story</h1>
        <img class="img" src="./images/cat2.avif" alt="">
        <p class="text">Hello, I am based in the UK and I have been learning to code since Nov, 2022. 
        <br>
        I enjoy many things about coding, learning the logic, attention to detail and the organizational nature of constructing webpages and apps. I also enjoy solving problems and the process of creating things.
        <br>
        In Nov, 2021 I received my diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. While reading books on people with autism, I found it was common for those with ASD to work in various coding roles. This resonated with me. Prior to learning coding I hadn't found a career path that would of been sustainable for me.
        <br> 
        I also have something called cancer-related fatigue which might limit my ability but not my desire to complete projects. (Don't worry the cancer is long gone!)
        <br>
        Above all, I really enjoy making things. Here is a selection of the things I have made.
